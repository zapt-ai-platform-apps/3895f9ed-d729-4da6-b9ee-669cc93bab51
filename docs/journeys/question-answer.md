This journey guides you through the process of asking a question and receiving an AI-generated answer.

## Steps

1. Navigate to the main page of the app.
2. Enter your question into the input field provided.
3. Click the "Submit" button. The button will be disabled during processing to prevent duplicate submissions.
4. The app sends your question to an external AI service, which processes and generates a real-time answer.
5. Wait for the answer to appear below the input field. A loading state will be displayed while the answer is being fetched.
6. Review the answer provided.

If any errors occur during the process, they will be logged to the developer console and reported via Sentry for analysis.
